# Minecraft Everything

## How to download

### Computer/PC

This is simple, on PC (Windows, Mac or Linux), you can download the .mcaddon file on [GitHub releases](https://github.com/esdraslov/Minecraft-Everything/releases) and double click it, this will work if you have Minecraft Launcher and Minecraft Bedrock installed.

### Mobile (Android)

1. On mobile, things get more complex, firstly, you must have [ZArchiver](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.zdevs.zarchiver)

4. Move to Android/data/com.mojang.minecraftpe (click the "..." folder before)
5. Hold the file and click the diagonal arrow
6. Find "Minecraft"

And you done installing Minecraft Everything!

## Experiments

Minecraft Everything requires **2 experiments**:
1. Beta APIs
2. Custom Biomes

This is very important since without *Beta APIs*, some items will not work and without *Custom Biomes*, well, you know, custom biomes can't spawn.
